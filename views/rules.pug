        | The goal of the game is to recreate the filled beaker. Click on a tool and then a beaker. Just click your way to victory!
        | Click on the mic button to communicate to your partner.
        | A beaker consists of four properties: volume, color, pH, and temperature.
        | There are two players: the Researcher, who can measure the beakers, and the Chemist, who can fill an empty beaker.

            li Ruler - Zoom into the beaker and use its markings to read the volume.
            li Color palette - Find the closest color on the color palette that matches your beaker.
            li pH meter - Use the pH meter to get a readout of the pH level.
            li Thermometer - Use the thermometer to get the temperature.

            li Cups of red, yellow, and blue water - Add water to your beaker. Adding multiple colors will give more hues, but don’t mix all three!
            li Acid and base cups - Adding acid lowers your pH level, and adding base gives you a higher pH. Use one to cancel the other out.
            li Bunsen burner - Heat your beaker with the Bunsen burner...
            li Icebox - Or cool it down with time in the icebox.
            li Sink - When there is a mistake made on the beaker, you can remove all of the beaker’s fluid using the sink.
